# **Big Sales Prediction using Random Forest Regressor**  

## **Overview**  
This project is a machine learning-based sales prediction model that leverages the **Random Forest Regressor** to forecast sales based on various influencing factors. The model is trained on a dataset containing store information, product categories, and historical sales data.  

## **Objective**  
The primary goal of this project is to develop a predictive model that can help businesses estimate future sales using machine learning techniques. This can assist in inventory management, marketing strategies, and revenue optimization.  

## **Dataset Information**  
- The dataset contains sales-related information, including store type, location, product category, and past sales records.  
- It is preprocessed to handle missing values and categorical variables.  
- Feature selection and engineering are performed to improve model performance.  

## **Technologies Used**  
- **Python**  
- **Pandas, NumPy** (Data Manipulation)  
- **Matplotlib, Seaborn** (Data Visualization)  
- **Scikit-Learn** (Machine Learning)  
- **Google Colab/Jupyter Notebook**  

## **Workflow**  
1. **Data Preprocessing:**  
   - Handling missing values by filling them with the median.  
   - Encoding categorical variables using Label Encoding.  
   - Splitting data into training and testing sets.  
   
2. **Model Training:**  
   - A **Random Forest Regressor** is trained on the dataset.  
   - Hyperparameter tuning is applied for optimal performance.  

3. **Model Evaluation:**  
   - Mean Absolute Error (MAE)  
   - Mean Squared Error (MSE)  
   - Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE)  
   - R-squared Score (RÂ²)  

4. **Feature Importance Analysis:**  
   - Visualizing the most influential factors in predicting sales.  

## **How to Use**  
1. Download the dataset (`big_sales_data.csv`) and place it in the working directory.  
2. Open the Jupyter Notebook or Google Colab.  
3. Run the cells step by step to train and evaluate the model.  
4. Save the trained model as `big_sales_rf_model.pkl`.  

## **Results**  
The project successfully builds a **Random Forest Regressor** model that provides accurate sales predictions with good performance metrics.  

## **Future Enhancements**  
- Implementing **deep learning models** for better predictions.  
- Hyperparameter tuning using **GridSearchCV** or **RandomizedSearchCV**.  
- Deploying the model using **Flask** or **FastAPI** for real-time predictions.
